# Pizza Shop - Web

##### React + TypeScript + Vite

This project is a restaurant dashboard designed for merchants who own a restaurant within a food delivery platform â€” similar to iFood. Built from scratch using React (without frameworks) and Tailwind CSS, the dashboard allows restaurant owners to:

- Register their restaurant, log in via email-based authentication (Magic Link), and log out.
- Monitor restaurant performance through charts and metrics (daily/monthly orders).
- View detailed information about each order.
- Update order statuses (e.g., preparing, delivering).
- Cancel orders when permitted.
- Filter orders by status, customer name, or order ID.
- Experience pagination, loading states, empty states, and skeleton screens across all lists.
- Switch between light and dark themes.

## Project Information

This project was developed as part of a module from the **Rocketseat React course**, with the goal of practicing key front-end concepts like component architecture, state and form management, API integration, and testing â€” all within a real-world dashboard scenario.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into two separate folders:

- **`pizzashop-web/`** â€“ The front-end application built during the Rocketseat React course.
- **`pizzashop-api/`** â€“ The back-end API provided by Rocketseat. This was cloned from the official repository and is required to support the front-end features (e.g., login, orders, metrics).
